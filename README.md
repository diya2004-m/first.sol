📜 PROJECT DESCRIPTION

DeckChain is a decentralized on-chain deck management system that allows users to create, shuffle, and draw cards securely using blockchain technology.
It’s perfect for card-based games, NFT collectibles, or any decentralized app where fairness and transparency matter.

Every deck and card is stored on-chain, ensuring that game logic is verifiable, immutable, and tamper-proof.
This project is designed for developers learning Solidity and decentralized game logic.


⚙️ What It Does

🎴 Users can create unique cards with custom metadata (e.g., name, image, attributes).

🧩 Combine cards into a deck managed by a smart contract.

🔀 Shuffle decks with pseudo-random logic (optionally extendable to Chainlink VRF for true randomness).

🃏 Draw cards one by one directly from the blockchain.

🔍 View remaining cards and verify deck integrity on-chain.

ðŸ“œ PROJECT DESCRIPTION

DeckChain is a decentralized on-chain deck management system that allows users to create, shuffle, and draw cards securely using blockchain technology.
Itâ€™s perfect for card-based games, NFT collectibles, or any decentralized app where fairness and transparency matter.

Every deck and card is stored on-chain, ensuring that game logic is verifiable, immutable, and tamper-proof.
This project is designed for developers learning Solidity and decentralized game logic.

📜 Project Description
DeckChain is a decentralized on-chain deck management system that allows users to create, shuffle, and draw cards securely using blockchain technology.
It’s perfect for card-based games, NFT collectibles, or any decentralized app where fairness and transparency matter.
Every deck and card is stored on-chain, ensuring that game logic is verifiable, immutable, and tamper-proof.
This project is designed for developers learning Solidity and decentralized game logic.

⚙️ What It Does


🎴 Users can create unique cards with custom metadata (e.g., name, image, attributes).


🧩 Combine cards into a deck managed by a smart contract.


🔀 Shuffle decks with pseudo-random logic (optionally extendable to Chainlink VRF for true randomness).


🃏 Draw cards one by one directly from the blockchain.


🔍 View remaining cards and verify deck integrity on-chain.



🌟 Features
🧠 Beginner-Friendly Solidity Code – Easy to read, modify, and extend.
🔒 Secure Deck Ownership – Only the deck creator can shuffle or draw cards.
⛓️ Fully On-Chain Transparency – Every card, deck, and shuffle is visible to everyone.
⚡ Gas-Efficient Design – Optimized data structures to save gas costs.
🪄 Extensible Architecture – Can integrate NFTs or randomness providers like Chainlink.
